  abstract  = {Automation and control systems, such as SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), DCS (Distributed
Control Systems) and are often referred to as Operational Technology (OT). These systems are used to monitor and
control critical infrastructures such as power, pipelines, water distribution, sewage systems and production
control,). Traditionally, these OT systems have had a degree of physical separation from Information Technology
(IT) infrastructures. With changing technologies and a drive towards data-driven and remote operations the two
technology environments are starting to converge. With this convergence, what was a relatively standalone secure
and isolated environment is now connected and accessible via the Internet/cloud. With this interconnection comes
the cyber security challenges that are typically associated with only with IT infrastructures. OT data that is then
accessible from these environments could include critical information such as pressures, temperatures, proximity
levels, control signals and other sensor signals. Due to the aforementioned convergence, OT data and associated
control mechanisms are now significantly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper provides an understanding of
cyber security in an operational technology context (rather than traditional IT environments) and discusses the
underlying causes, vulnerabilities, and the risks that are created by convergence and interconnection. We report on
evidence of convergence between IT and OT, and use Hofstede’s model of organisational culture to explain the
different attitudes and value drivers in IT and OT.},

  abstract    = {IT/OT convergence is a major phenomenon enabled by the exponential pace of
technological innovations that is currently transforming the way we interact with and
evolve in our world.
First, in order to understand the boundary between IT and OT, clear definitions of
these technological concepts are given before studying the key principles of the IT
business value creation: Identification, Creation and Realization.
This professional thesis proposes a framework for the categorization of the benefits
resulting from the IT/OT convergence in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries. This categorization is applied to outputs obtained from a field study in
which nine professionals from the senior management of leading organizations in that
business area were interviewed. We make observations about the distinction
between Operational benefits and Strategic benefits and set out what the challenges
reported by the participants are.
IT/OT convergence is at the root of several better-known IT challenges, such as
Internet of Things, Big Data, Cloud computing, Smart computing, Bring Your Own
Device and Shadow IT. Finally, we study their inter-linkage and examine how the
findings from the study of these better-known IT challenges could support the IT/OT
convergence.},
